            </div>
            <div class="description">
                <p>A metaphor is a mapping from one domain to another.For example, moo is cow as beep is to car. These mappings get so buried in our language that we don't even notice their effects.</p>
                <p>For example, take the language used to describe a debate:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><b>"He shot down her ideas."</b></li>
                    <li><b>"She defended her position."</b></li>
                    <li><b>"She overwhelmed his arguments."</b></li>
                    <li><b>"He had to retreat from that position."</b></li>
                </ul>
                <p>There are all debate-as-war metaphors.It's a zero sum game. Someone wins  and someone loses. The idea that both people could learn from each other just doesn't come up.</p>
